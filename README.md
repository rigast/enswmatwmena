# Embedded Systems
 
 embedded_sys is an application that enables communication between two devices. The first device is the server (in this application a Zsun) and the second one is the client. Every time a client wants to communicate, the code that runs on the server creates a socket in a predefined port.

The application achieves parallel communication with multiple clients,using processes (processwise) and threads (threadwise).
